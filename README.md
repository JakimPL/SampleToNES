# SampleTONes

v0.2.0


## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.12 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Windows
1. Make sure Python 3.12 is installed and available as `python` in your PATH.
2. Double-click `install.bat` in this folder. It will build a standalone `sampletones.exe` in the same directory.
3. Run `sampletones.exe` to start the application.

### macOS / Linux
1. Make sure Python 3.12 is installed and available as `python3` in your PATH.
2. Open a terminal in this folder and run:
	```sh
	./install.sh
	```
	This will build a standalone `sampletones` executable in the same directory.
3. Run `./sampletones` to start the application.

### Alternative: Install as a Python Package

If you already have a Python 3.12 environment set up (for example, using `venv` or another virtual environment tool), you can install and run _SampleToNES_ directly as a package:

1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Activate your Python 3.12 environment.
3. Install the package:
    ```sh
    pip install .
    ```
4. Run the application:
    ```sh
    sampletones
    ```
